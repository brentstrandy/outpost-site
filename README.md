Baseman
=======

This is a base [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) application. This
sets all of the defaults that I'll generally set when building a new
application on Middleman. Be sure to read all of the documentation to
become familiar with Middleman before using this base setup.

Setup
-----

```shell
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Running the Application
-----------------------

You run the application by starting the Middleman server:

```shell
middleman s
```


Deploying
---------

### To GitHub Pages

- You can deploy by running `rake publish` from your project's root.
